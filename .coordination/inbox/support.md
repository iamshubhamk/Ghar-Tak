## [OPEN] OR-005 — Kickoff: build the test plan; no tests or monitoring exist yet
From: orchestrator | Date: 2026-10-27 | Priority: normal
What changed: Workspace set up. Discovery: backend tests can't run (stale SQLAlchemy fixtures; backend
owns that fix as OR-001), no frontend or mobile tests, no error tracking, logs only go to stdout via
`app/core/logger.py`, no uptime checks or analytics.
Why: The booking state machine and auth are the riskiest areas and have no coverage.
Action needed in this workstream: Write `docs/qa/test-plan.md`: booking lifecycle matrix (every
status × every actor × every action, expected allow/deny), auth cases, provider verification flow,
low-end-device/3G checks. Propose the error tracking + uptime tooling (free tier) to the human. Start
writing E2E/API tests once backend's fixtures work.
